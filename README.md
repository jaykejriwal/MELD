# Relationship between acoustic and emotion entrainment
Python program for understanding the relationship between acoustic and emotional entrainment.

## Dataset
We utilized Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset (MELD) to understand the relationship betweem acosutic-prosodic and emotion entrainmnet. 
The dataset can be downloaded from https://affective-meld.github.io/

## Required Software
ffmpeg (Download from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
PRAAT

## Execution instruction

One Jupyter Notebook files is uploaded. The file presents a step-by-step procedure for extracting features and measuring entrainment distance. 

R code is uploaded for further analysis.
